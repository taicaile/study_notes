AutoML and Neural Architecture Search
- the system will automatically determine all the paramters, we just feed the data...
- it use reinforcement learning and recurrent neural networks to optimize the overall system.

AutoAugment: RL For data augumentation
- data augumentation is taking the raw data and messing in a way of giving much richer represestation what the data can look like.
